From **Project Control** at a globally recognized EPC company to **AI & Machine Learning Enthusiast**, I'm weaving together my experience in mega-project management with cutting-edge tech - think of it as upgrading from construction blueprints to neural networks!
 
👋 Hi there! I’m Eric Chung—a former Project Control Engineer turned AI explorer. My journey began orchestrating large-scale infrastructure projects, where I drove cost control and schedule management for some of the most intricate engineering challenges But my passion for **data** and **AI-driven solutions** inspired me to switch gears and dive deep into the fascinating realms of **machine learning** and **deep learning**.  

Think of me as an **engineer-turned-data-whisperer**, solving problems one algorithm at a time while applying the precision of project management to the limitless possibilities of AI.

## **What I Do 💡**
🔹 **Machine Learning & AI Enthusiast**:  
Building solutions that go beyond traditional data analysis and machine learning. I specialize in **deep learning**, with hands-on experience in **computer vision** and **natural language processing**. From training neural networks to fine-tuning pre-trained models, I thrive on turning complex data into actionable insights.  

🔹 **Project Manager Turned Data Explorer**:  
Drawing from my engineering project management background, I bring a structured, results-driven mindset to every data problem I tackle. Just as we plan massive projects by breaking them into achievable milestones, I approach data challenges piece by piece - unlocking new possibilities at the intersection of project management and data science.
