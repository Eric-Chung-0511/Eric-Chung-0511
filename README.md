From **Project Control** at a globally recognized EPC company to **AI & Machine Learning Enthusiast**, I'm weaving together my experience in mega-project management with cutting-edge tech - think of it as upgrading from construction blueprints to neural networks!
 
👋 Hi there! I’m Eric Chung— a Project Control Engineer on a journey to transition into the world of **AI** and **machine learning**. My career began with orchestrating large-scale infrastructure projects, where I managed cost control and schedules for intricate engineering challenges. But my growing passion for **data** and **AI-driven solutions** has led me to dive deep into **machine learning** and **deep learning**, as I work to bridge my project management expertise with the power of AI. 

Think of me as an **engineer-turned-data-whisperer**, solving problems one algorithm at a time while applying the precision of project management to the limitless possibilities of AI.

## **What I Do 💡**
🔹 **Machine Learning & AI Enthusiast**:  
I go beyond traditional **machine learning** by diving deep into **deep learning** techniques. With hands-on experience in **computer vision** and **natural language processing**, I specialize in training neural networks and fine-tuning pre-trained models. I’m passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive real-world impact.

🔹 **Project Manager Turned Data Explorer**:  
Drawing from my engineering project management background, I bring a structured, results-driven mindset to every data problem I tackle. Just as we plan massive projects by breaking them into achievable milestones, I approach data challenges piece by piece - unlocking new possibilities at the intersection of project management and data science.
