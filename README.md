 👋 Hello! I'm Eric Chung, a Project Control Engineer with a profound enthusiasm for Data Science and Machine Learning.
 
🔹 Driven by a passion to unlock insights and solve complex challenges, I'm actively seeking opportunities to pivot my career towards a role as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.

🔹 As I dive deeper into the data realm in my spare time, I am eager to apply my skills in a dynamic environment, embracing challenges and contributing to innovative solutions.

Curious about the projects keep me up at night ? Just take a leap into my Learning Record ! 👇

It's where I stash all my data-driven adventures and machine learning escapades. It’s like my professional diary, but with less teenage angst and more algorithms 😉
