# 👋 Hi, I'm Eric — From Project Control Engineer to AI Explorer

I began my career as a **Project Control Engineer** at a globally recognized EPC company, managing Schedule and Cost for large-scale infrastructure projects. Over time, I became deeply intrigued by the power of **data** and **AI-driven systems**, especially their potential to bring scalable solutions to the real world.

Now, I’m combining the structured mindset of engineering execution with hands-on **machine learning development**, from training deep learning models to deploying full-stack AI applications.

## 💡 What I Do

🔹 **Machine Learning & AI Enthusiast**  
Hands-on in **deep learning**, **computer vision**, **NLP**, and **model deployment**, with a focus on building useful, explainable, and well-integrated AI solutions.

🔹 **Engineer Turned AI Builder**  
From managing construction schedules to orchestrating multi-model AI systems, I carry the same structured, iterative mindset—whether defining MVPs or architecting segmentation pipelines. I bring ideas from concept to working code: background replacement with Lab color space correction, multimodal fusion with YOLO + CLIP, morphological feature extractors that enhance CNN reasoning.

🔹 **Data Quality Advocate**  
I believe in _"Garbage in, garbage out"_—a lesson that applies as much to training transformers as it does to a poorly defined CPM schedule. Whether it's feature engineering for XGBoost or preprocessing for diffusion models, a well-prepared dataset determines everything downstream.
