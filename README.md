# 👋 Hi, I'm Eric — From Project Control Engineer to AI Explorer

I began my career as a **Project Control Engineer** at a globally recognized EPC company, managing cost and schedules for large-scale infrastructure projects. Over time, I became deeply intrigued by the power of **data** and **AI-driven systems**, especially their potential to bring scalable solutions to the real world.

Now, I’m combining the structured mindset of engineering execution with hands-on **machine learning development**, from training deep learning models to deploying full-stack AI applications.

## ✨ Highlights at a Glance

- 🐾 **PawMatchAI**  
   A hybrid model for **dog breed classification and recommendation**, combining CNN, Transformer, and custom feature extractors.  
   Designed to help users **identify breeds**, **compare characteristics**, and **find a good match**.  
   **Previously featured on Hugging Face’s “Spaces of the Week”**, with 30K+ visits.

- 🛰️ **Vision Scout**
   An advanced multi-modal scene understanding system that orchestrates **YOLOv8**, **CLIP**, **Places365**, and **Llama 3.2** in intelligent collaboration to deliver comprehensive visual analysis. This integration enables the system to simultaneously process object detection, semantic context, environmental classification, and linguistic refinement, producing **narrative descriptions that transform raw visual data into human-readable stories**. The system identifies **functional zones**, analyzes **lighting conditions**, and infers **activities and safety considerations** through sophisticated multi-model fusion techniques.
   **Featured in Hugging Face's "Spaces of the Week"** for its innovative storytelling-driven approach to computer vision.

## 💡 What I Do

🔹 **Machine Learning & AI Enthusiast**  
Hands-on in **computer vision**, **NLP**, and **model deployment**, with a focus on building useful, explainable, and well-integrated AI solutions.

🔹 **Engineer Turned Data Explorer**  
From managing construction schedules and cost to training models, I carry the same structured, iterative mindset — whether it’s defining MVPs or analyzing feature contributions.

I also have experience with **feature engineering**, **data preprocessing**, and **traditional machine learning pipelines**. I believe in the principle of _"Garbage in, garbage out"_: a lesson that applies as much to XGBoost as it does to a poorly defined CPM schedule. A well-prepared dataset, like a well-sequenced project timeline, determines everything downstream.
