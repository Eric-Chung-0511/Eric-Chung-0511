# 👋 Hi, I'm Eric — From Project Control Engineer to AI Explorer

I began my career as a **Project Control Engineer** at a globally recognized EPC company, managing cost and schedules for large-scale infrastructure projects. Over time, I became deeply intrigued by the power of **data** and **AI-driven systems**, especially their potential to bring scalable solutions to the real world.

Now, I’m combining the structured mindset of engineering execution with hands-on **machine learning development**, from training deep learning models to deploying full-stack AI applications.

## 💡 What I Do

🔹 **Machine Learning & AI Enthusiast**  
Hands-on in **computer vision**, **NLP**, and **model deployment**, with a focus on building useful, explainable, and well-integrated AI solutions.

🔹 **Engineer Turned Data Explorer**  
From managing construction schedules and cost to training models, I carry the same structured, iterative mindset — whether it’s defining MVPs or analyzing feature contributions.

I also have experience with **feature engineering**, **data preprocessing**, and **traditional machine learning pipelines**. I believe in the principle of _"Garbage in, garbage out"_: a lesson that applies as much to XGBoost as it does to a poorly defined CPM schedule. A well-prepared dataset, like a well-sequenced project timeline, determines everything downstream.
